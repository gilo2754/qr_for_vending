# QR Code Generator API

API for generating and managing QR codes for vending machines.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Google Drive account (for backups)

## Running with Docker

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd qr_for_vending
```

2. Create a `.env` file from the example and configure your environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Edit the `.env` file with your specific configuration values.

3. Build and start the containers:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

The API will be available at http://localhost:3000

## Automatic Backups

The application includes an automatic backup system that:
- Creates database backups every 5 minutes
- Compresses backups using gzip
- Uploads backups to Google Drive
- Maintains a 7-day retention policy
- Stores backups in both local storage and Google Drive

### Backup Configuration

The backup system is configured in the `docker-compose.yml` file and uses:
- A dedicated backup container (`mysql-backup`)
- Cron for scheduling
- Rclone for Google Drive integration

### Backup Files

Backups are stored in:
- Local: `./backups/` directory
- Google Drive: In the configured folder

Backup files follow the naming convention: `waterDB_YYYYMMDD-HHMM.sql.gz`

## API Documentation

Once the server is running, you can access:
- Swagger UI: http://localhost:3000/docs
- ReDoc: http://localhost:3000/redoc

## API Endpoints

- POST `/api/qrdata` - Create a new QR code
- GET `/api/qrdata/{qrcode_id}` - Get QR code information
- GET `/api/qrcodes` - List all QR codes (with pagination)
- PUT `/api/qrdata/exchange/{qrcode_id}` - Exchange a QR code

## QR Code States

QR codes can have the following states:

- **v√°lido**: The QR code is active and can be used to make a purchase in the vending machine.
- **usado**: The QR code has already been exchanged for a product in the vending machine and cannot be used again.
- **expirado**: The QR code has exceeded its validity date and can no longer be used.
- **invalidado**: The QR code has been manually invalidated for some reason (for example, if a problem or fraud is detected).

These states allow:
- Tracking the complete lifecycle of a QR code
- Preventing multiple uses of the same code
- Managing the temporal validity of codes
- Responding to exceptional situations

## Development

To run the application in development mode:

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up the database:
```bash
mysql -u <your_user> -p < 01-create-database.sql
```

4. Run the application:
```bash
python qrcode_generator.py
```

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables must be configured in your `.env` file:

### API Configuration
- `API_URL` - API base URL
- `API_HOST` - API host address
- `API_PORT` - API port number
- `DEBUG` - Debug mode flag

### Database Configuration
- `DB_HOST` - Database host address
- `DB_USER` - Database username
- `DB_PASSWORD` - Database password
- `DB_NAME` - Database name

### QR Code Configuration
- `QR_MIN_VALUE` - Minimum QR code value
- `QR_SHORT_ID_LENGTH` - Length of QR code ID

### Security Configuration
- `CORS_ORIGINS` - Allowed CORS origins
- `RATE_LIMIT` - API rate limit
- `RATE_LIMIT_PERIOD` - Rate limit period in minutes

### Logging Configuration
- `LOG_LEVEL` - Logging level (INFO, DEBUG, etc.)

### Backup Configuration
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` - Google OAuth client ID
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` - Google OAuth client secret

### Time Zone Notes

It is important to note the difference between the time zones used in the application:

- **GUI (User Interface)**: Displays dates and times in El Salvador's time zone (UTC-6).
- **Database**: Stores dates and times in the local time zone of the server where the application is running (usually in the USA).

This difference is intentional and is designed so that users in El Salvador see dates and times in their local time zone, while the database maintains a consistent record in the server's time zone.

The conversion between time zones is performed automatically in the user interface through the `formatDateToElSalvador()` function, which adjusts dates and times to display them correctly in El Salvador's time zone.
